## 🧠 About the Game

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician **John Horton Conway** in 1970. It's a zero-player game that evolves over time based on its initial state, following simple rules.

### Rules

Each cell can be **alive** or **dead**:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
